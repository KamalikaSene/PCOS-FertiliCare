      <p>
        PCOS, or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, is a prevalent hormonal condition affecting women in their late teens or early twenties. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism (elevated male hormones causing ovarian cysts), anovulation (irregular or absent ovulation), and the presence of multiple fluid-filled sacs on the ovaries.
